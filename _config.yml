          ¿Qué sabéis sobre observabilidad?
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          La observabilidad te ayuda a entender mejor tu sistema y saber que está pasando en todo momento. Y lo más importante, facilitar y agilizar el análisis y solución de problema.

          En la charla voy a hablar sobre la Observability y sus pilares: mensajes de logs, métricas y trazas. Además, voy a hacer una demo donde veréis la Observabilidad en acción y descubriréis lo útil que es.
